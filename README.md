# Bitbucket.el #

An Emacs wrapper for the Bitbucket API

## TODO ##

This project is a work in progress. I have only ported the Issues endpoints, which allows Bitbucket integration for [git-commit-insert-issue](https://gitlab.com/emacs-stuff/git-commit-insert-issue)

If you need more endpoints added, create an issue, or even better send a pull request.

## Inspiration ##

This project has been inspired by the great [emacs-gitlab](https://github.com/nlamirault/emacs-gitlab)
